\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a soon-to-be Computer Science undergraduate. My speciality is in artificial intelligence and data science, well-versed in implementing deep-learning neural networks. I was a founding member \& Director of Programmes of a non-profit society that organised tech workshops, competitions and hackathons for students and the disadvantaged. During my compulsory military service, I spearheaded leadership development projects in the Army. Contextualising the knowledge I have gained about military leadership to the private sector and coupled with my prior leadership experiences, I am suitably equipped with the skills required to build \& lead high-performing teams.

\lettersection{Why Rohde \& Schwarz?}
Purpose-driven, I enjoy work that make a difference in people's lives. Naturally, that has led me to my specialisation in AI, as I firmly believe that the digital world of tomorrow will be largely enabled by AI, where products \& services of higher quality \& complexity are created to enhance safety and the quality of people's lives. With Rohde \& Schwarz's wide diversity of solutions in many business fields, I feel like there is much scope for me to apply my skills to bring meaningful projects to fruition. Particularly, fields like wireless communications, signal processing, cybersecurity, are on the brink of an AI revolution --- recent advances in AI has allowed for novel applications in these fields, markedly improving performance --- and that excites me.

\lettersection{Why Me?}

Today, we live in a world shaken up by technological disruption, where trends \& threats have become increasingly volatile and uncertain. To thrive in such a turbulent world, one needs to be a fast learner, and a critical-thinker with mental tenacity. As a leader, one needs to be adaptive, well-informed of future developments to maintain strategic foresight, and be people-oriented as well to elevate the commitment and professional knowledge of those around him. Highly driven and inventive, coupled with my technical and leadership expertise, I feel like I am uniquely equipped with the traits mentioned above to be able to steer our organisation towards success in today's age of digital transformation.
